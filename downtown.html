      <div>Jaho Coffee Roasters- Located close to the Boston Commons and Emerson college! They roast their own coffee beans and they also have espresso martinis and wine! Their iced lattes are super fun because they use super crushed ice cubes almost giving a snow cone effect, if that makes sense. Over all great vibe and enough space to do work in! </div>
