        <li>The purpose of this website to support small businesses and help people find new local coffeeshops!</li>
        <li>I want each page to have at least 3 ranked coffee shops in each category with a small picture of the shop. I also want to link their Instagram page and do a little personal description about them. </li>
        <li>I also want to create a video slide show, if I can, on the cover</li>
